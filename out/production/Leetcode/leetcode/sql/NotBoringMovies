X city opened a new cinema, many people would like to go to this cinema. The cinema also gives out a poster indicating the moviesâ€™ ratings and descriptions.
Please write a SQL query to output movies with an odd numbered ID and a description that is not 'boring'. Order the result by rating.



For example, table cinema:

+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
|   id    | movie     |  description |  rating   |
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
|   1     | War       |   great 3D   |   8.9     |
|   2     | Science   |   fiction    |   8.5     |
|   3     | irish     |   boring     |   6.2     |
|   4     | Ice song  |   Fantacy    |   8.6     |
|   5     | House card|   Interesting|   9.1     |
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
For the example above, the output should be:
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
|   id    | movie     |  description |  rating   |
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
|   5     | House card|   Interesting|   9.1     |
|   1     | War       |   great 3D   |   8.9     |
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+

select *
from cinema
where mod(id, 2) = 1 and description != 'boring'
order by rating DESC;
