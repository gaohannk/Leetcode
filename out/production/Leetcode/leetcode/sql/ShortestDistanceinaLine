Table point holds the x coordinate of some points on x-axis in a plane, which are all integers.


Write a query to find the shortest distance between two points in these points.


| x   |
|-----|
| -1  |
| 0   |
| 2   |


The shortest distance is '1' obviously, which is from point '-1' to '0'. So the output is as below:


| shortest|
|---------|
| 1       |


SELECT MIN(ABS(p1.x - p2.x)) AS shortest
FROM point p1
JOIN point p2
ON p1.x != p2.x;
