Write a SQL query to get the nth highest salary from the Employee table.

+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
For example, given the above Employee table, the nth highest salary where n = 2 is 200. If there is no nth highest salary, then the query should return null.

+------------------------+
| getNthHighestSalary(2) |
+------------------------+
| 200                    |
+------------------------+


REATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT`
BEGIN
RETURN (
# Write your MySQL query statement below.

CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
  RETURN (
      # Write your MySQL query statement below.
    SELECT

    CASE
        WHEN N NOT BETWEEN 1 AND (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Salary) FROM Employee) THEN NULL
    ELSE
         (SELECT
                MIN(Salary)
          FROM
                (SELECT DISTINCT
                    Salary
                 FROM
                    Employee
                 ORDER BY
                    Salary DESC
                 LIMIT
                    N) data)
      END
  );
END


CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
SET N=N-1;
  RETURN (
      select DISTINCT  Salary from Employee order by Salary desc limit N,1

  );
