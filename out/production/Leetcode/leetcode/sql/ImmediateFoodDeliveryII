Table: Delivery

+-----------------------------+---------+
| Column Name                 | Type    |
+-----------------------------+---------+
| delivery_id                 | int     |
| customer_id                 | int     |
| order_date                  | date    |
| customer_pref_delivery_date | date    |
+-----------------------------+---------+
delivery_id is the primary key of this table.
The table holds information about food delivery to customers that make orders at some date and specify a preferred delivery date (on the same order date or after it).


If the preferred delivery date of the customer is the same as the order date then the order is called immediate otherwise it's called scheduled.

The first order of a customer is the order with the earliest order date that customer made. It is guaranteed that a customer has exactly one first order.

Write an SQL query to find the percentage of immediate orders in the first orders of all customers, rounded to 2 decimal places.

The query result format is in the following example:

Result table:

| immediate_percentage |
+----------------------+
| 50.00                |
+----------------------+
The customer id 1 has a first order with delivery id 1 and it is scheduled.
The customer id 2 has a first order with delivery id 2 and it is immediate.
The customer id 3 has a first order with delivery id 5 and it is scheduled.
The customer id 4 has a first order with delivery id 7 and it is immediate.
Hence, half the customers have immediate first orders.
