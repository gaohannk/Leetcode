A pupil Tim gets homework to identify whether three line segments could possibly form a triangle.


However, this assignment is very heavy because there are hundreds of records to calculate.


Could you help Tim by writing a query to judge whether these three sides can form a triangle, assuming table triangle holds the length of the three sides x, y and z.


| x  | y  | z  |
|----|----|----|
| 13 | 15 | 30 |
| 10 | 20 | 15 |
For the sample data above, your query should return the follow result:
| x  | y  | z  | triangle |
|----|----|----|----------|
| 13 | 15 | 30 | No       |
| 10 | 20 | 15 | Yes      |

SELECT
    x, y, z,
    CASE
        WHEN x + y > z AND x + z > y AND y + z > x THEN 'Yes'
        ELSE 'No'
    END AS 'triangle'
FROM
    triangle
;
