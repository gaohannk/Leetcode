Explanation

According to order '3' and '4' in table orders, it is easy to tell only salesperson 'John' and 'Alex' have sales to company 'RED',
so we need to output all the other names in table salesperson.

SELECT
    s.name
FROM
    salesperson s
WHERE
    s.sales_id NOT IN (SELECT
            o.sales_id
        FROM
            orders o
                LEFT JOIN
            company c ON o.com_id = c.com_id
        WHERE
            c.name = 'RED')
;
