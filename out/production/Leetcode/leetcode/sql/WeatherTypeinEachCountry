Result table:
+--------------+--------------+
| country_name | weather_type |
+--------------+--------------+
| USA          | Cold         |
| Austraila    | Cold         |
| Peru         | Hot          |
| China        | Warm         |
| Morocco      | Hot          |
+--------------+--------------+
Average weather_state in USA in November is (15) / 1 = 15 so weather type is Cold.
Average weather_state in Austraila in November is (-2 + 0 + 3) / 3 = 0.333 so weather type is Cold.
Average weather_state in Peru in November is (25) / 1 = 25 so weather type is Hot.
Average weather_state in China in November is (16 + 18 + 21) / 3 = 18.333 so weather type is Warm.
Average weather_state in Morocco in November is (25 + 27 + 31) / 3 = 27.667 so weather type is Hot.
We know nothing about average weather_state in Spain in November so we don't include it in the result table.
