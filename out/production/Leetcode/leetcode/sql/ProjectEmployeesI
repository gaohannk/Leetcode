Table: Employee

+------------------+---------+

employee_id is the primary key of this table.


Write an SQL query that reports the average experience years of all the employees for each project, rounded to 2 digits.

The query result format is in the following example:

Project table:
+-------------+-------------+
| project_id  | employee_id |
+-------------+-------------+
| 1           | 1           |
| 1           | 2           |
| 1           | 3           |
| 2           | 1           |
| 2           | 4           |
+-------------+-------------+

Employee table:
+-------------+--------+------------------+
| employee_id | name   | experience_years |
+-------------+--------+------------------+
| 1           | Khaled | 3                |
| 2           | Ali    | 2                |
| 3           | John   | 1                |
| 4           | Doe    | 2                |
+-------------+--------+------------------+

Result table:
+-------------+---------------+
| project_id  | average_years |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1           | 2.00          |
| 2           | 2.50          |
+-------------+---------------+
The average experience years for the first project is (3 + 2 + 1) / 3 = 2.00 and for the second project is (3 + 2) / 2 = 2.50


SELECT             p.project_id,
                   ROUND(AVG(e.experience_years), 2) AS average_years
FROM               Project AS p
INNER JOIN         Employee AS e
ON                 p.employee_id = e.employee_id
GROUP BY           p.project_id
