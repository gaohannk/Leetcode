Write an SQL query that reports the products that were only sold in spring 2019. That is, between 2019-01-01 and 2019-03-31 inclusive.

The query result format is in the following example:

Product table:
+------------+--------------+------------+
| product_id | product_name | unit_price |
+------------+--------------+------------+
| 1          | S8           | 1000       |
| 2          | G4           | 800        |
| 3          | iPhone       | 1400       |
+------------+--------------+------------+

Sales table:
+-----------+------------+----------+------------+----------+-------+
| seller_id | product_id | buyer_id | sale_date  | quantity | price |
+-----------+------------+----------+------------+----------+-------+
| 1         | 1          | 1        | 2019-01-21 | 2        | 2000  |
| 1         | 2          | 2        | 2019-02-17 | 1        | 800   |
| 2         | 2          | 3        | 2019-06-02 | 1        | 800   |
| 3         | 3          | 4        | 2019-05-13 | 2        | 2800  |
+-----------+------------+----------+------------+----------+-------+

Result table:
+-------------+--------------+
| product_id  | product_name |
+-------------+--------------+
| 1           | S8           |
+-------------+--------------+
The product with id 1 was only sold in spring 2019 while the other two were sold after.

select p.product_id, p.product_name from Sales as s
join Product as p
on s.product_id = p.product_id
group by p.product_id
having min(s.sale_date) >= '2019-01-01' and max(s.sale_date) <= ' 2019-03-31'


SELECT product_id, product_name
FROM Product
WHERE product_id IN (
    SELECT product_id
    FROM Sales
    GROUP BY product_id
    HAVING MIN(sale_date) >= '2019-01-01' AND MAX(sale_date) <= '2019-03-31')
