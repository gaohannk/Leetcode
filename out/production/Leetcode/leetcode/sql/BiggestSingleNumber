Table my_numbers contains many numbers in column num including duplicated ones.
Can you write a SQL query to find the biggest number, which only appears once.

+---+
|num|
+---+
| 8 |
| 8 |
| 3 |
| 3 |
| 1 |
| 4 |
| 5 |
| 6 |
For the sample data above, your query should return the following result:
+---+
|num|
+---+
| 6 |

Note:
If there is no such number, just output null.


SELECT
    MAX(num) AS num
FROM
    (SELECT
        num
    FROM
        my_numbers
    GROUP BY num
    HAVING COUNT(num) = 1) AS t;


SELECT IFNULL((SELECT MAX(num) FROM (SELECT num from my_numbers GROUP BY my_numbers.num HAVING COUNT(my_numbers.num) = 1) AS a), NULL) AS num;
