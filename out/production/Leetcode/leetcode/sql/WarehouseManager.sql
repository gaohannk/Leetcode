| warehouse_name | volume     |
+----------------+------------+
| LCHouse1       | 12250      |

Volume of product_id = 1 (LC-TV), 5x50x40 = 10000
Volume of product_id = 2 (LC-KeyChain), 5x5x5 = 125
Volume of product_id = 3 (LC-Phone), 2x10x10 = 200
Volume of product_id = 4 (LC-T-Shirt), 4x10x20 = 800
LCHouse1: 1 unit of LC-TV + 10 units of LC-KeyChain + 5 units of LC-Phone.
          Total volume: 1*10000 + 10*125  + 5*200 = 12250 cubic feet
LCHouse2: 2 units of LC-TV + 2 units of LC-KeyChain.
          Total volume: 2*10000 + 2*125 = 20250 cubic feet
LCHouse3: 1 unit of LC-T-Shirt.
          Total volume: 1*800 = 800 cubic feet.
