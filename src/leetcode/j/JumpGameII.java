/* Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.
 * Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.
 * Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.
 * For example:
 * Given array A = [2,3,1,1,4]
 * The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. (Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, 
 * then 3 steps to the last index.)
 */
/* DP: let F(i) denote the minimum number of jumps, then we have F(i) = min(F(j) ) + 1 where j = 0, … i – 1, 
 * this is O(N^2) approach and will get TLE by the OJ
