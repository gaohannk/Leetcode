/**
 * Given a string s, we make queries on substrings of s.
 *
 * For each query queries[i] = [left, right, k], we may rearrange the substring s[left], ..., s[right], and then choose up to k of them to replace with any lowercase English letter.
 *
 * If the substring is possible to be a palindrome string after the operations above, the result of the query is true. Otherwise, the result is false.
 *
 * Return an array answer[], where answer[i] is the result of the i-th query queries[i].
 *
 * Note that: Each letter is counted individually for replacement so if for example s[left..right] = "aaa", and k = 2, we can only replace two of the letters.  (Also, note that the initial string s is never modified by any query.)
 *
 *
 *
 * Example :
 *
 * Input: s = "abcda", queries = [[3,3,0],[1,2,0],[0,3,1],[0,3,2],[0,4,1]]
 * Output: [true,false,false,true,true]
 * Explanation:
 * queries[0] : substring = "d", is palidrome.
 * queries[1] : substring = "bc", is not palidrome.
 * queries[2] : substring = "abcd", is not palidrome after replacing only 1 character.
 * queries[3] : substring = "abcd", could be changed to "abba" which is palidrome. Also this can be changed to "baab" first rearrange it "bacd" then replace "cd" with "ab".
 * queries[4] : substring = "abcda", could be changed to "abcba" which is palidrome.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *     1 <= s.length, queries.length <= 10^5
 *     0 <= queries[i][0] <= queries[i][1] < s.length
 *     0 <= queries[i][2] <= s.length
 *     s only contains lowercase English letters.
