/* Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix. This matrix has the following properties:
 * Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
 * The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.
 * For example,
 * Consider the following matrix:
 * [
 *   [1,   3,  5,  7],
 *   [10, 11, 16, 20],
 *   [23, 30, 34, 50]
 * ]
 * Given target = 3, return true.
 */
/* You may try to solve this problem by finding the row first and then the column. 
 * There is no need to do that. Because of the matrix's special features, the matrix can be considered as a sorted array. 
 * Your goal is to find one element in this sorted array by using binary search.
