/**
 * A password is considered strong if below conditions are all met:
 * <p>
 * It has at least 6 characters and at most 20 characters.
 * It must contain at least one lowercase letter, at least one uppercase letter, and at least one digit.
 * It must NOT contain three repeating characters in a row ("...aaa..." is weak, but "...aa...a..." is strong, assuming other conditions are met).
 * Write a function strongPasswordChecker(s), that takes a string s as input, and return the MINIMUM change required to make s a strong password. If s is already strong, return 0.
 * <p>
 * Insertion, deletion or replace of any one character are all considered as one change.
 */
/*This solution scans the password string twice.
First pass: check lacks of lower/upper/digit char.
Second pass: deals with repeating characters case based on the current length of the character.
