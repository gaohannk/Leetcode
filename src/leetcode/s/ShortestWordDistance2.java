 * Given a list of words and two words word1 and word2, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.
 * For example,
 * Assume that words = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"].
 * Given word1 = "coding", word2 = "practice", return 3. Given word1 = "makes", word2 = "coding", return 1.
 * Note:
 * You may assume that word1 does not equal to word2, and word1 and word2 are both in the list.
