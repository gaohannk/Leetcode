/**
 * Given the availability time slots arrays slots1 and slots2 of two people and a meeting duration duration, return the earliest time slot that works for both of them and is of duration duration.
 *
 * If there is no common time slot that satisfies the requirements, return an empty array.
 *
 * The format of a time slot is an array of two elements [start, end] representing an inclusive time range from start to end.
 *
 * It is guaranteed that no two availability slots of the same person intersect with each other. That is, for any two time slots [start1, end1] and [start2, end2] of the same person, either start1 > end2 or start2 > end1.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: slots1 = [[10,50],[60,120],[140,210]], slots2 = [[0,15],[60,70]], duration = 8
 * Output: [60,68]
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: slots1 = [[10,50],[60,120],[140,210]], slots2 = [[0,15],[60,70]], duration = 12
 * Output: []
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= slots1.length, slots2.length <= 10^4
 * slots1[i].length, slots2[i].length == 2
 * slots1[i][0] < slots1[i][1]
 * slots2[i][0] < slots2[i][1]
 * 0 <= slots1[i][j], slots2[i][j] <= 10^9
 * 1 <= duration <= 10^6
