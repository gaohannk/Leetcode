/**
 * Given an array arr of positive integers, consider all binary trees such that:
 *
 * Each node has either 0 or 2 children;
 * The values of arr correspond to the values of each leaf in an in-order traversal of the tree.  (Recall that a node is a leaf if and only if it has 0 children.)
 * The value of each non-leaf node is equal to the product of the largest leaf value in its left and right subtree respectively.
 * Among all possible binary trees considered, return the smallest possible sum of the values of each non-leaf node.  It is guaranteed this sum fits into a 32-bit integer.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: arr = [6,2,4]
 * Output: 32
 * Explanation:
 * There are two possible trees.  The first has non-leaf node sum 36, and the second has non-leaf node sum 32.
 *
 *     24            24
 *    /  \          /  \
 *   12   4        6    8
 *  /  \               / \
 * 6    2             2   4
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 2 <= arr.length <= 40
 * 1 <= arr[i] <= 15
 * It is guaranteed that the answer fits into a 32-bit signed integer (ie. it is less than 2^31).
