/* Given an integer matrix, find the length of the longest increasing path.
 * From each cell, you can either move to four directions: left, right, up or down. You may NOT move diagonally or move outside of the boundary (i.e. wrap-around is not allowed).
 * Example 1:
 * nums = [
 * 	[9,9,4],
 * [6,6,8],
 * [2,1,1]
 * ]
Return 4
The longest increasing path is [1, 2, 6, 9].

Example 2:

nums = [
  [3,4,5],
  [3,2,6],
  [2,2,1]
]
Return 4
The longest increasing path is [3, 4, 5, 6]. Moving diagonally is not allowed.
