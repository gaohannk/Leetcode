/**
 * Given an array of integers arr, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.
 *
 * In one step you can jump from index i to index:
 *
 * i + 1 where: i + 1 < arr.length.
 * i - 1 where: i - 1 >= 0.
 * j where: arr[i] == arr[j] and i != j.
 * Return the minimum number of steps to reach the last index of the array.
 *
 * Notice that you can not jump outside of the array at any time.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: arr = [100,-23,-23,404,100,23,23,23,3,404]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: You need three jumps from index 0 --> 4 --> 3 --> 9. Note that index 9 is the last index of the array.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: arr = [7]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: Start index is the last index. You don't need to jump.
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: arr = [7,6,9,6,9,6,9,7]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: You can jump directly from index 0 to index 7 which is last index of the array.
 * Example 4:
 *
 * Input: arr = [6,1,9]
 * Output: 2
 * Example 5:
 *
 * Input: arr = [11,22,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,22,13]
 * Output: 3
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= arr.length <= 5 * 10^4
 * -10^8 <= arr[i] <= 10^8
