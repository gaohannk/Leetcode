/* This is a follow up of Shortest Word Distance. The only difference is now word1 could be the same as word2. 
 * Given a list of words and two words word1 and word2, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list. 
 * word1 and word2 may be the same and they represent two individual words in the list. 
 * For example, 
 * Assume that words = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"]. 
 * Given word1 = “makes”, word2 = “coding”, return 1. 
 * Given word1 = "makes", word2 = "makes", return 3. 
 * Note: 
 * You may assume word1 and word2 are both in the list.
