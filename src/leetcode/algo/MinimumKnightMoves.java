/**
 * In an infinite chess board with coordinates from -infinity to +infinity, you have a knight at square [0, 0].
 *
 * A knight has 8 possible moves it can make, as illustrated below. Each move is two squares in a cardinal direction, then one square in an orthogonal direction.
 *
 *
 *
 * Return the minimum number of steps needed to move the knight to the square [x, y].  It is guaranteed the answer exists.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: x = 2, y = 1
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: [0, 0] → [2, 1]
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: x = 5, y = 5
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: [0, 0] → [2, 1] → [4, 2] → [3, 4] → [5, 5]
