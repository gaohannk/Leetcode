/**
 * Given a list of unique words, find all pairs of distinct indices (i, j) in the given list, so that the concatenation of the two words, i.e. words[i] + words[j] is a palindrome.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: ["abcd","dcba","lls","s","sssll"]
 * Output: [[0,1],[1,0],[3,2],[2,4]]
 * Explanation: The palindromes are ["dcbaabcd","abcddcba","slls","llssssll"]
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: ["bat","tab","cat"]
 * Output: [[0,1],[1,0]]
 * Explanation: The palindromes are ["battab","tabbat"]
