/**
 * Given a list of points that form a polygon when joined sequentially, find if this polygon is convex (Convex polygon definition).
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * <p>
 * There are at least 3 and at most 10,000 points.
 * Coordinates are in the range -10,000 to 10,000.
 * You may assume the polygon formed by given points is always a simple polygon (Simple polygon definition). In other words, we ensure that exactly two edges intersect at each vertex, and that edges otherwise don't intersect each other.
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * [[0,0],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0]]
 * <p>
 * Answer: True
 * <p>
 * Explanation:
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * [[0,0],[0,10],[10,10],[10,0],[5,5]]
 * <p>
 * Answer: False
 * <p>
