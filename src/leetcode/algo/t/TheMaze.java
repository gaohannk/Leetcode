/**
 * There is a ball in a maze with empty spaces and walls. The ball can go through empty spaces by rolling up, down, left or right, but it won't stop rolling until hitting a wall. When the ball stops, it could choose the next direction.
 *
 * Given the ball's start position, the destination and the maze, determine whether the ball could stop at the destination.
 *
 * The maze is represented by a binary 2D array. 1 means the wall and 0 means the empty space. You may assume that the borders of the maze are all walls. The start and destination coordinates are represented by row and column indexes.
 *
 * Example 1
 *
 * Input 1: a maze represented by a 2D array
 *
 * 0 0 1 0 0
 * 0 0 0 0 0
 * 0 0 0 1 0
 * 1 1 0 1 1
 * 0 0 0 0 0
 *
 * Input 2: start coordinate (rowStart, colStart) = (0, 4)
 * Input 3: destination coordinate (rowDest, colDest) = (4, 4)
 *
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: One possible way is : left -> down -> left -> down -> right -> down -> right.
 *
 * Example 2
 *
 * Input 1: a maze represented by a 2D array
 *
 * 0 0 1 0 0
 * 0 0 0 0 0
 * 0 0 0 1 0
 * 1 1 0 1 1
 * 0 0 0 0 0
 *
 * Input 2: start coordinate (rowStart, colStart) = (0, 4)
 * Input 3: destination coordinate (rowDest, colDest) = (3, 2)
 *
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: There is no way for the ball to stop at the destination.
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * There is only one ball and one destination in the maze.
 * Both the ball and the destination exist on an empty space, and they will not be at the same position initially.
 * The given maze does not contain border (like the red rectangle in the example pictures), but you could assume the border of the maze are all walls.
 * The maze contains at least 2 empty spaces, and both the width and height of the maze won't exceed 100.
