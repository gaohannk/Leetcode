/**
 * Given two sequences pushed and popped with distinct values, return true if and only if this could have been the result of a sequence of push and pop operations on an initially empty stack.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: pushed = [1,2,3,4,5], popped = [4,5,3,2,1]
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: We might do the following sequence:
 * push(1), push(2), push(3), push(4), pop() -> 4,
 * push(5), pop() -> 5, pop() -> 3, pop() -> 2, pop() -> 1
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: pushed = [1,2,3,4,5], popped = [4,3,5,1,2]
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: 1 cannot be popped before 2.
 *
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * 0 <= pushed.length == popped.length <= 1000
 * 0 <= pushed[i], popped[i] < 1000
 * pushed is a permutation of popped.
 * pushed and popped have distinct values.
