/**
 * For some fixed N, an array A is beautiful if it is a permutation of the integers 1, 2, ..., N, such that:
 *
 * For every i < j, there is no k with i < k < j such that A[k] * 2 = A[i] + A[j].
 *
 * Given N, return any beautiful array A.  (It is guaranteed that one exists.)
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: 4
 * Output: [2,1,4,3]
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: 5
 * Output: [3,1,2,5,4]
