/**
 * We are given an array A of N lowercase letter strings, all of the same length.
 *
 * Now, we may choose any set of deletion indices, and for each string, we delete all the characters in those indices.
 *
 * For example, if we have an array A = ["abcdef","uvwxyz"] and deletion indices {0, 2, 3}, then the final array after deletions is ["bef", "vyz"], and the remaining columns of A are ["b","v"], ["e","y"], and ["f","z"].  (Formally, the c-th column is [A[0][c], A[1][c], ..., A[A.length-1][c]].)
 *
 * Suppose we chose a set of deletion indices D such that after deletions, each remaining column in A is in non-decreasing sorted order.
 *
 * Return the minimum possible value of D.length.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: ["cba","daf","ghi"]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation:
 * After choosing D = {1}, each column ["c","d","g"] and ["a","f","i"] are in non-decreasing sorted order.
 * If we chose D = {}, then a column ["b","a","h"] would not be in non-decreasing sorted order.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: ["a","b"]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: D = {}
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: ["zyx","wvu","tsr"]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: D = {0, 1, 2}
