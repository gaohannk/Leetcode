/* The demons had captured the princess (P) and imprisoned her in the bottom-right corner of a dungeon.
 * The dungeon consists of M x N rooms laid out in a 2D grid. 
 * Our valiant knight (K) was initially positioned in the top-left room and must fight his way through the dungeon to rescue the princess.
 * The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. 
 * If at any point his health point drops to 0 or below, he dies immediately.
 * Some of the rooms are guarded by demons, so the knight loses health (negative integers) upon entering these rooms;other rooms are either empty (0's) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (positive integers).
 * In order to reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only rightward or downward in each step.
 * Write a function to determine the knight's minimum initial health so that he is able to rescue the princess.
 * For example, given the dungeon below, the initial health of the knight must be at least 7 if he follows the optimal path RIGHT-> RIGHT -> DOWN -> DOWN.
 * -2 (K)  -3	  3
 * -5	   -10	  1
 *  10	    30	 -5 (P)
 * Notes:
 * The knight's health has no upper bound.
 * Any room can contain threats or power-ups, even the first room the knight enters and the bottom-right room where the princess is imprisoned.
