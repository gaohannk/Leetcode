/* After robbing those houses on that street, the thief has found himself a new place for his thievery so that he will not get too much attention.
 * This time, all houses at this place are arranged in a circle. 
 * That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one.
 * Meanwhile, the security system for these houses remain the same as for those in the previous street.
 * Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, 
 * determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.
