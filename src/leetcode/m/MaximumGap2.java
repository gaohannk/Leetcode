/* Given an unsorted array, find the maximum difference between the successive elements in its sorted form.
 * Try to solve it in linear time/space.
 * Return 0 if the array contains less than 2 elements.
 * You may assume all elements in the array are non-negative integers and fit in the 32-bit signed integer range.
 */
/* Suppose there are N elements and they range from A to B.
 * Then the maximum gap will be no smaller than ceiling[(B - A) / (N - 1)]
 * Let the length of a bucket to be len = ceiling[(B - A) / (N - 1)], then we will have at most num = (B - A) / len + 1 of bucket
 * for any number K in the array, we can easily find out which bucket it belongs by calculating loc = (K - A) / len and therefore maintain the maximum and minimum elements in each bucket.
 * Since the maximum difference between elements in the same buckets will be at most len - 1, so the final answer will not be taken from two elements in the same buckets.
 * For each non-empty buckets p, find the next non-empty buckets q, then q.min - p.max could be the potential answer to the question. Return the maximum of all those values.
