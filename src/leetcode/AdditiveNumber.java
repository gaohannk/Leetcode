/* Additive number is a positive integer whose digits can form additive sequence.
 * A valid additive sequence should contain at least three numbers. Except for the first two numbers, each subsequent number in the sequence must be the sum of the preceding two.
 * For example:
 * "112358" is an additive number because the digits can form an additive sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8.
 * 1 + 1 = 2, 1 + 2 = 3, 2 + 3 = 5, 3 + 5 = 8
 * "199100199" is also an additive number, the additive sequence is: 1, 99, 100, 199.
 * 1 + 99 = 100, 99 + 100 = 199
 * Note: Numbers in the additive sequence cannot have leading zeros, so sequence 1, 2, 03 or 1, 02, 3 is invalid.
 * Given a string represents an integer, write a function to determine if it's an additive number.
 * Follow up:
 * How would you handle overflow for very large input integers?
