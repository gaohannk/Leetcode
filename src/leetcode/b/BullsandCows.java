/* You are playing the following Bulls and Cows game with your friend: 
 * You write a 4-digit secret number and ask your friend to guess it, each time your friend guesses a number, you give a hint, 
 * the hint tells your friend how many digits are in the correct positions (called "bulls") and how many digits are in the wrong positions 
 * (called "cows"), your friend will use those hints to find out the secret number.
 * For example:
 * Secret number:  1807
 * Friend's guess: 7810
 * Hint: 1 bull and 3 cows. (The bull is 8, the cows are 0, 1 and 7.)
 * According to Wikipedia: "Bulls and Cows (also known as Cows and Bulls or Pigs and Bulls or Bulls and Cleots) is an old code-breaking mind 
 * or paper and pencil game for two or more players, predating the similar commercially marketed board game Mastermind. 
 * The numerical version of the game is usually played with 4 digits, but can also be played with 3 or any other number of digits."
 * Write a function to return a hint according to the secret number and friend's guess, use A to indicate the bulls and B to indicate the cows, 
 * in the above example, your function should return 1A3B.
 * You may assume that the secret number and your friend's guess only contain digits, and their lengths are always equal.
