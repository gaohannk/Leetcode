/**
 * Given an 2D board, count how many different battleships are in it. The battleships are represented with 'X's, empty slots are represented with '.'s. You may assume the following rules:
 * <p>
 * You receive a valid board, made of only battleships or empty slots.
 * Battleships can only be placed horizontally or vertically. In other words, they can only be made of the shape 1xN (1 row, N columns) or Nx1 (N rows, 1 column).
 * At least one horizontal or vertical cell separates between two battleships - there are no adjacent battleships.
 * Example:
 * X..X
 * ...X
 * ...X
 * In the above board there are 2 battleships.
 * Your algorithm should not modify the value of the board.
