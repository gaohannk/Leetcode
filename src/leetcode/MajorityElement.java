/*
 * Given an array of size n, find the majority element. 
 * The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊ n/2 ⌋ times.
 * You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.
 */
/* Solution 1 Runtime: O(n2) — Brute force solution: Check each element if it is the majority element.
 * Solution 2 Runtime: O(n), Space: O(n) — Hash table: Maintain a hash table of the counts of each element, then find the most common one.
 * Solution 3 Runtime: O(n log n) — Sorting: Find the longest contiguous identical element in the array after sorting.
 *
 * Solution 4 Average runtime: O(n), Worst case runtime: Infinity — Randomization: Randomly pick an element and check if it is the majority element.
 * If it is not, do the random pick again until you find the majority element. 
 * As the probability to pick the majority element is greater than 1/2, the expected number of attempts is < 2.
 *
 * Solution 5 Runtime: O(n log n) — Divide and conquer: Divide the array into two halves, then find the majority element
 * A in the first half and the majority element B in the second half. 
 * The global majority element must either be A or B. If A == B, then it automatically becomes the global majority element. 
 * If not, then both A and B are the candidates for the majority element, and it is suffice to check the count of occurrences for at most two candidates. 
 * The runtime complexity, T(n) = T(n/2) + 2n = O(n log n).
 *
 * Solution 6 Runtime: O(n) — Moore voting algorithm: We maintain a current candidate and a counter initialized to 0.
 * As we iterate the array, we look at the current element x:
 * If the counter is 0, we set the current candidate to x and the counter to 1.
 * If the counter is not 0, we increment or decrement the counter based on whether x is the current candidate.
 * After one pass, the current candidate is the majority element. Runtime complexity = O(n).
 *
 * Solution 7 Runtime: O(n) — Bit manipulation: We would need 32 iterations, each calculating the number of 1's for the ith bit of all n numbers.
 * Since a majority must exist, therefore, either count of 1's > count of 0's or vice versa (but can never be equal).
 * The majority number’s ith bit must be the one bit that has the greater count.
