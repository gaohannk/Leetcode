/* You are given a m x n 2D grid initialized with these three possible values.
 * -1 - A wall or an obstacle.
 * 0 - A gate.
 * INF - Infinity means an empty room. 
 * We use the value 2^31 - 1 = 2147483647 to represent INF as you may assume that the distance to a gate is less than2147483647.
 * Fill each empty room with the distance to its nearest gate. If it is impossible to reach a gate, it should be filled with INF.
 * For example, given the 2D grid:
 * INF  -1  0  INF
 * INF INF INF  -1
 * INF  -1 INF  -1
 * 0  -1 INF INF
 * After running your function, the 2D grid should be:
 * 3  -1   0   1
 * 2   2   1  -1
 * 1  -1   2  -1
 * 0  -1   3   4
