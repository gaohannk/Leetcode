/* Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth smallest element in it.
 * Note: 
 * You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ BST's total elements.
 * Follow up:
 * What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?
 * Hint:
 * Try to utilize the property of a BST.
 * What if you could modify the BST node's structure?
 * The optimal runtime complexity is O(height of BST).
