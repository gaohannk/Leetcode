/* There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the three colors: red, blue or green.
 * The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different.
 * You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.
 * The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x 3 cost matrix.
 * For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with color red;
 * costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so on...
 * Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.
 * Note:
 * All costs are positive integers.
