 * Given a collection of integers that might contain duplicates, S, return all possible subsets.
 * Note:
 * Elements in a subset must be in non-descending order.
 * The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.
 * For example,
 * If S = [1,2,2], a solution is:
 * [
 *   [2],
 *   [1],
 *   [1,2,2],
 *   [2,2],
 *   [1,2],
 *   []
