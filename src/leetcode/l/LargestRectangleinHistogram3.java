/* Given n non-negative integers representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, find the area of largest rectangle in the histogram.
 * Above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1, given height = [2,1,5,6,2,3].
 * The largest rectangle is shown in the shaded area, which has area = 10 unit.
 * For example,
 * Given height = [2,1,5,6,2,3],
 * return 10.

/*
 * We traverse all bars from left to right, maintain a stack of bars. Every bar is pushed to stack once. 
 * A bar is popped from stack when a bar of smaller height is seen
 * When a bar is popped, we calculate the area with the popped bar as smallest bar. 
 * How do we get left and right indexes of the popped bar – the current index tells us the ‘right index’
 * and index of previous item in stack is the ‘left index’. 
 * Following is the complete algorithm.
 * 1) Create an empty stack.
 * 2) Start from first bar, and do following for every bar ‘hist[i]‘ where ‘i’ varies from 0 to n-1.
 *   a) If stack is empty or hist[i] is higher than the bar at top of stack, then push ‘i’ to stack.
 *   b) If this bar is smaller than the top of stack, then keep removing the top of stack while top of the stack is greater.
 *      Let the removed bar be hist[tp]. Calculate area of rectangle with hist[tp] as smallest bar.
 *      For hist[tp], the ‘left index’ is previous (previous to tp) item in stack and ‘right index’ is ‘i’ (current index).
 * 3) If the stack is not empty, then one by one remove all bars from stack and do step 2.b for every removed bar.
