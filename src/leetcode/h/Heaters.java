/**
 * Winter is coming! Your first job during the contest is to design a standard heater with fixed warm radius to warm all the houses.
 * <p>
 * Now, you are given positions of houses and heaters on a horizontal line, find out minimum radius of heaters so that all houses could be covered by those heaters.
 * <p>
 * So, your input will be the positions of houses and heaters seperately, and your expected output will be the minimum radius standard of heaters.
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * Numbers of houses and heaters you are given are non-negative and will not exceed 25000.
 * Positions of houses and heaters you are given are non-negative and will not exceed 10^9.
 * As long as a house is in the heaters' warm radius range, it can be warmed.
 * All the heaters follow your radius standard and the warm radius will the same.
 * Example 1:
 * Input: [1,2,3],[2]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: The only heater was placed in the position 2, and if we use the radius 1 standard, then all the houses can be warmed.
 * Example 2:
 * Input: [1,2,3,4],[1,4]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: The two heater was placed in the position 1 and 4. We need to use radius 1 standard, then all the houses can be warmed.
