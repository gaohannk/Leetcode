/* Given an integer n, return the number of trailing zeroes in n!.

 */
/* Because all trailing 0 is from factors 5 * 2.
 * But sometimes one number may have several 5 factors, for example, 25 have two 5 factors, 125 have three 5 factors. 
 * In the n! operation, factors 2 is always ample. So we just count how many 5 factors in all number from 1 to n.
