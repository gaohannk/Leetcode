/* There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n - 1.
 * Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1,
 * which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]
 * Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?
 * For example:
 * 2, [[1,0]]
 * There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
 * 2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
 * There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
 * Note:
 * The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
